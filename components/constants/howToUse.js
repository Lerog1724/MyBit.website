    <p>
      The MyBit Network is powered by the MyBit Token (MYB).
      It’s used for everything from executing specific functions
      with our SDKs to accessing features of applications. Basically,
      all apps built on MyBit (including MyBitGO) use MYB to function.
      The token’s also used to fund the growth of the network through
      MyBit Ventures and other developer reward programmes.

          Burn tokens to use SDKs and applications
          Developers burn MYB tokens to use applications within the
          Network, like gas on the Ethereum network.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lock tokens for asset collateral
          Users can lock their MYB, adding a layer of security for
          investors on the MyBitGo investment platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stake tokens for DAX
          Users can stake their MYB tokens, in exchange for DAX tokens which offer a
          50% discount on trading fees when using the MYDAX exchange.
        </li>
        <li>
          Access layers on dApps
          Many dApps built using MyBit’s technology stack require a one time burning of
          MYB to unlock the application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Investing in funds
          Users can lock MYB tokens to help fund promising dApps through MyBit Ventures.
          Successful applications can then join the DDF to rapidly scale development.
